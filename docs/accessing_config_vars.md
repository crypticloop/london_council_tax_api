# Accessing Heroku Config Vars
>A method of mitigating need for secrets stored in plain text

## Setting Vars
### UI
* Go to `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[app-name]/settings`
  * Also found where on far right of dashboard toolbar
* Enter key and value
  * Convention: Key in **capitals**

### CLI
* Also a way to do it with CLI, but don't use that that much
